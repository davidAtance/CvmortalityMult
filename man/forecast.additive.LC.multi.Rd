\usage{
\method{forecast}{additive.LC.multi}(
  fitted.obj,
  nahead,
  ktmethod = c("Arimapdq", "arima010"),
  kt_include.cte = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fitted.obj}{object developed using function \code{fit.additive.LC.multi()}.}

\item{nahead}{number of periods ahead to forecast.}

\item{ktmethod}{method used to forecast the value of \code{kt} Arima(p,d,q) or ARIMA(0,1,0); c("\code{Arimapdq}", "\code{arima010}").}

\item{kt_include.cte}{if you want that \code{kt} include constant in the arima process.}
}
\value{
A list with different components of the forecasting process:
\itemize{
\item \code{ax} parameter that captures the average shape of the mortality curve in all considered populations.
\item \code{bx} parameter that explains the age effect x with respect to the general trend \code{kt} in the mortality rates of all considered populations.
\item \code{arimakt} the arima selected for the \code{kt} time series.
\item \code{kt.fitted} obtained values for the tendency behaviour captured by \code{kt}.
\item \code{kt.fut} projected values of \code{kt} for the nahead periods ahead.
\item \code{kt.futintervals} arima selected and future values of \code{kt} with the different intervals, lower and upper, 80\\% and 90\\%.
\item \code{Ii} paramater that captures the differences in the pattern of mortality in any region i with respect to Region 1.
\item \code{formula} additive multi-population mortality formula used to fit the mortality rates.
\item \code{qxt.real} real mortality rates.
\item \code{qxt.fitted} fitted mortality rates using the additive multi-population mortality model.
\item \code{logit.qxt.fitted} fitted mortality rates in logit way estimated with the additive multi-population mortality model.
\item \code{qxt.future} future mortality rates estimated with the additive multi-population mortality model.
\item \code{logit.qxt.future} future mortality rates in logit way estimated with the additive multi-population mortality model.
\item \code{nPop} provided number of populations to fit the periods.

\description{
R function for forecasting additive multi-population mortality model developed by: Debon et al (2011).
This model follows the structure of the well-known Lee-Carter model (Lee and Carter, 1992) but including an additive parameter to capture the behavior of each population considered.
This parameter seeks to capture the individual behavior of every population considered.
It should be mentioned that in case that this function is developed for forecasting several populations.
However, in case you only consider one population, the function will forecast the Lee-Carter model for one population.

#Before forecast the future value of the mortality rates for different populations
#we need the object the fitted values of the additive multi-population mortality model.
