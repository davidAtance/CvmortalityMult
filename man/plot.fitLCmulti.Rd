\title{Function to plot the parameters of the multi-population mortality models}
\usage{
\method{plot}{fitLCmulti}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{x} developed using function \code{fitLCmulti()} which are objects of the \code{fitLCmulti} class.}

\item{...}{additional arguments to show in the plot appearance.}
}
\value{
plot the different parameters for the multi-population mortality models \code{ax}, \code{bx}, \code{kt} and \code{Ii}. This function is valid for both approaches Additive and Multiplicative multi-population mortality models.
}
\description{
R function to plot the parameters for the Additive (Debon et al., 2011) and Multiplicative (Russolillo et al., 2011) Multi-Population mortality model.
It should be mentioned that in case that this function is developed for fitting several populations.
However, in case you only consider one population, the function will fit the one-population Lee-Carter model (Lee and Carter, 1992).
