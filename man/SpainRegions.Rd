\description{
Data from the Spanish region of Spain from the Spanish National Institute of Statistics (INE) for both genders years 1991-2020 and abridged ages from 0 to 90.
This dataset contains mortality rates (qxt) from 18 different regions of Spain.
Additionally, the dataset includes the number of people alive (lxt) for each age and period.

In this case, we show the region dataset applying it to a multipopulation model.
#First, we present the dataset
SpainRegions
#An example to how the additive multi-population model fits the data
