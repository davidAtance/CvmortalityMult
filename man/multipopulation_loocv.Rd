\description{
R function for testing the accuracy out-of-sample of different multi-population mortality models, Additive (Debon et al., 2011) and Multiplicative (Russolillo et al., 2011).
We provide a R function that employ the leave-one-out cross-validation technique for data panel-time series (Atance et al. 2020) to test the forecasting accuracy of one-multipopulation mortality model.
This technique consists on split the database in two parts: training set (to run the model) and test set (to check the forecasting accuracy of the model) with only one data (one period in this case).
This procedure is repeated several times trying to check the forecasting accuracy in different ways enlarging the training set one period-ahead.
With this function, the user can provide its own mortality rates for different populations. The function will split the database chronologically (Bergmeir and Benitez, 2012) based on the trainset1 which consist on the length of the first training set.
We have include the following Figure 2 to understand how the R function works.
{\figure{LOOCV.png}{options: width="100\%" alt="Figure: mai.png"}}
It should be mentioned that this function is developed for testing the the forecasting accuracy of several populations using leave-one-out cross-validation .
However, in case you only consider one population, the function will forecast the Lee-Carter model for one population.
To test the forecasting accuracy of the selected model, the function provides five different measures: SSE, MSE, MAE, MAPE or All. Depending on how you want to check the forecasting accuracy of the model you could select one or other.
In this case, the measures will be obtained using the mortality rates in the normal scale as recommended by Santolino (2023) against the log scale.
