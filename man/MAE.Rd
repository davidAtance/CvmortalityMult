\title{MEAN ABSOLUTE ERRORS (MAE)}
\usage{
MAE(qxt_re, qxt_aju, wxt)
}
\arguments{
\item{qxt_re}{real mortality rates used to check the goodness of fit measure.}

\item{qxt_aju}{adjusted mortality rates using a specific mode.}

\item{wxt}{weights of the mortality rates or data provided.}
}
\value{
A value of MAE for the data provided.
}
\description{
R function to estimate the mean absolute errors (MAE) for the mortality rates;
\deqn{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{x} \sum_{t} \left| qx1 - qxt2 \right|}.
where qxt1 is the real mortality rates \code{qxt_re}, and qxt2 is the adjusted mortality rates \code{qxt_aju}.
You only have to provide the real value and the fitted or forecasted value for your mortality rates.
However, the function is constructed to provide the real value and the fitted or forecasted value of your independent variable.
These variables must have the same dimensions to be compared.

\examples{
#The example takes more than 5 seconds because it includes
#several fitting and forecasting process and hence all
#the process is included in dontrun
\dontrun{
#To show how the function works, we need to provide fitted or forecasted data and the real data.
#In this case, we employ the following data of the library:
SpainRegions
library(gnm)
ages <- c(0, 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90)
#In this case, we fit for males providing the lxt
multiplicative_Spainmales <- fit_multiplicative.LC.multi(qxt = SpainRegions$qx_male,
                              periods = c(1991:2020),
                              ages = c(ages),
                              nPop = 18,
                              lxt = SpainRegions$lx_male)

#Once, we have the fitted data, we will obtain the SSE for the first population.
#We need to obtain wxt (weight of the mortality rates or data provided) using a
library(StMoMo)
wxt_1pob <- genWeightMat(ages = ages, years = c(1991:2020), clip = 0)
MAE(qxt_re = multiplicative_Spainmales$qxt.real$pob1,
    qxt_aju = multiplicative_Spainmales$qxt.fitted$pob1,
    wxt = wxt_1pob)
}
