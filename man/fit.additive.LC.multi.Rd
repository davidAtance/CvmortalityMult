\title{FUNCTION TO FIT ADDITIVE MULTI-POPULATION MORTALITY MODEL}
\usage{
fit.additive.LC.multi(qxt, periods, ages, nPop, lxt = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{qxt}{mortality rates used to fit the additive multipopulation mortality model. This rates can be provided in matrix or in data.frame.}

\item{periods}{periods considered in the fitting in a vector way c(minyear:maxyear).}

\item{ages}{vector with the ages considered in the fitting. If the mortality rates provide from an abbridged life tables, it is necessary to provide a vector with the ages, see the example.}

\item{nPop}{number of population considered for fitting.}

\item{lxt}{survivor function considered for every population, not necessary to provide.}
}
\value{
A list with different components of the fitting process:
\item{ax}{parameter that captures the average shape of the mortality curve in all considered populations.}

\item{bx}{parameter that explains the age effect x with respect to the general trend (kt) in the mortality rates of all considered populations.}

\item{kt}{represent the national tendency of multi-mortality populations during the period.}

\item{Ii}{gives an idea of the differences in the pattern of mortality in any region i with respect to Region 1.}

\item{formula}{additive multi-population mortality formula used to fit the mortality rates.}

\item{data.used}{mortality rates used to fit the data.}

\item{qxt.real}{real mortality rates.}

\item{qxt.fitted}{fitted mortality rates using the additive  multi-population mortality model.}

\item{logit.qxt.fitted}{fitted mortality rates in logit way.}

\item{Ages}{provided ages to fit the data.}

\item{Periods}{provided periods to fit the peridos.}

\item{nPop}{provided number of populations to fit the periods.}
}
\description{
R function for fitting additive multi-population mortality model developed by: Debon et al (2011).
This model follows the structure of the well-known Lee-Carter model (Lee and Carter, 1992) but including an additive parameter to capture the behavior of each population considered.
This parameter seeks to capture the individual behavior of every population considered.
It should be mentioned that in case that this function is developed for fitting several populations.
However, in case you only consider one population, the function will fit the one-population Lee-Carter model.

#In this case, we fit for males providing the lxt

                              lxt = SpainRegions$lx_male)

#Once, we have fit the data, it is possible to see the \eqn{\alpha_x}, \eqn{\beta_x}, \eqn{k_t}, and \eqn{I_i} provided parameters for the fitting.

#Equal to the previous step but in this case for females and without providing lxt.

#As we mentioned in the details of the function, if we only provide the data from one-population the function
