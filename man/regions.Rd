\format{
A data frame with 600 rows and 9 columns with the following information
\itemize{
\item \code{Codigo} a vector containing the code of every region of Spain.
\item \code{Texto} a vector containing the name of every region of Spain.
\item \code{Texto_Alt} a vector containing the long name of every region of Spain.
\item \code{Ii} a vector containing a possible value of one indicator to be shown.
\item \code{geometry} the dimension of every region of Spain. This vector allows to plot the regions of Spain.
}
}
\usage{
regions
}
\value{
a plot with the Spain regions colored by the indicator provided.
}
\description{
Data from the Spanish region of Spain which are provided to plot an indicator.
This dataset contains a plot with the information of Spain regions (geometry and name of every region).

In this case, we show the region dataset applying it to a multipopulation model.
#First, we present the dataset
