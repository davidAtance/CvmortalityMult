CvmortalityMult (Cross-Validation in Multi-population mortality models) is an R package providing the implementation of cross-validation method for testing the forecasting accuracy of five multi-population mortality models. The family of multi-population includes different multi-population mortality models proposed through the actuarial and demography literature. 
The package includes functions for fitting and forecast the mortality rates of several populations. Additionally, we include several Cross-Validation functions for testing the forecasting accuracy of different multi-population models in different perspectives.
